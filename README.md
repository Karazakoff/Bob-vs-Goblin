## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pygame.
```bash
pip install pygame
```
If you are using python3:
```bash
pip3 install pygame
```
Clone the repository:
```bash
git init
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karazakoff/PyGame.git
```

## Usage

Using the terminal go to the repository which you cloned. And run the file **start.py**.
``` bash
python3 start.py
```
_We recommend you turn off the volume because there are no options in-game to make your voice lower._

After executing the command above, use:

**W** - To jump

**A** - Move left

**D** - Move right

**Space** - Shoot with projectiles
